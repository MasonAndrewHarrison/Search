Elon musk is the richest man alive. The World Wealth Report defines HNWIs as those who hold at least US$1 million in assets excluding primary residence and ultra-HNWIs as those who hold at least US$30 million in assets excluding primary residence.[9] The report states that in 2008 there were 8.6 million HNWIs worldwide, a decline of 14.9% from 2007. The total HNWI wealth worldwide totaled US$32.8 trillion, a 19.5% decrease from 2007. The ultra-HNWIs experienced the greater loss, losing 24.6% in population size and 23.9% in accumulated wealth. The report revised its 2007 projections that HNWI financial wealth would reach US$59.1 trillion by 2012 and revised this downward to a 2013 HNWI wealth valued at $48.5 trillion advancing at an annual rate of 8.1%.<>

Musk was born and grew up in Pretoria, South Africa. He attended the University of Pretoria before moving to Canada at age 17, acquiring citizenship through his Canadian-born mother. Two years later, he matriculated at Queen's University and transferred to the University of Pennsylvania, where he received bachelor's degrees in economics and physics. Elon Musk moved to California in 1995 to attend Stanford University but decided to instead pursue a business career, co-founding the web software company Zip2 with his brother, Kimbal. The startup was acquired by Compaq for $307 million in 1999. The same year, Musk co-founded the online bank X.com, which merged with Confinity in 2000 to form PayPal. eBay bought PayPal in 2002 for $1.5 billion.<>

The Lord of the Rings is an epic[1] high-fantasy novel[a] by English author and scholar J. R. R. Tolkien. Set in Middle-earth, intended to be Earth at some time in the distant past, the story began as a sequel to Tolkien's 1937 children's book The Hobbit, but eventually developed into a much larger work. Written in stages between 1937 and 1949, The Lord of the Rings is one of the best-selling books ever written, with over 150 million copies sold.[2] The title refers to the story's main antagonist, the Dark Lord Sauron, who, in an earlier age, created the One Ring to rule the other Rings of Power given to Men, Dwarves, and Elves, in his campaign to conquer all of Middle-earth. From homely beginnings in the Shire, a hobbit land reminiscent of the English countryside, the story ranges across Middle-earth, following the quest to destroy the One Ring mainly through the eyes of the hobbits Frodo, Sam, Merry and Pippin.<>

Apollo 4, also known as SA-501, was the first, uncrewed, flight in the United States Apollo program, and the first test of the Saturn V launch vehicle, the rocket that would be used to send astronauts to the Moon. The space vehicle was the first to be launched from Kennedy Space Center in Florida, lifting off from Launch Complex 39A, where facilities designed specially for the Saturn V had been constructed, on November 9, 1967 – depicted in this photograph. The original launch date was planned for late 1966, but was delayed due to a myriad of problems with various elements of the spacecraft, and difficulties during pre-flight testing. Also contributing to the delays was the need for additional inspections following the Apollo 1 fire that killed the first Apollo crew in January 1967. These issues delayed the flight through much of 1967. The mission splashed down in the Pacific Ocean slightly less than nine hours after launch, having achieved its objectives.<>
American science fiction author and editor Lester del Rey wrote, "Even the devoted aficionado or fan—has a hard time trying to explain what science fiction is," and the lack of a "full satisfactory definition" is because "there are no easily delineated limits to science fiction."[9] According to Isaac Asimov, "Science fiction can be defined as that branch of literature which deals with the reaction of human beings to changes in science and technology."[10] Robert A. Heinlein wrote that "A handy short definition of almost all science fiction might read: realistic speculation about possible future events, based solidly on adequate knowledge of the real world, past and present, and on a thorough understanding of the nature and significance of the scientific method."[11]
Part of the reason that it is so difficult to pin down an agreed definition of science fiction is because there is a tendency among science fiction enthusiasts to act as their own arbiter in deciding what exactly constitutes science fiction.[12] Damon Knight summed up the difficulty, saying "science fiction is what we point to when we say it."[13] Ultimately, it may be more useful to talk around science fiction as the intersection of other, more concrete, genres and subgenres.[14] <>

Some scholars assert that science fiction had its beginnings in ancient times, when the line between myth and fact was blurred.[23] Written in the 2nd century CE by the satirist Lucian, A True Story contains many themes and tropes characteristic of modern science fiction, including travel to other worlds, extraterrestrial lifeforms, interplanetary warfare, and artificial life. Some consider it the first science-fiction novel.[24] Some of the stories from The Arabian Nights,[25][26] along with the 10th-century The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter[26] and Ibn al-Nafis's 13th-century Theologus Autodidactus,[27] also contain elements of science fiction.
Written during the Scientific Revolution and the Age of Enlightenment, Johannes Kepler's Somnium (1634), Francis Bacon's New Atlantis (1627),[28] Athanasius Kircher's Itinerarium extaticum (1656),[29] Cyrano de Bergerac's Comical History of the States and Empires of the Moon (1657) and The States and Empires of the Sun (1662), Margaret Cavendish's "The Blazing World" (1666),[30][31][32][33] Jonathan Swift's Gulliver's Travels (1726), Ludvig Holberg's Nicolai Klimii Iter Subterraneum (1741) and Voltaire's Micromégas (1752) are regarded as some of the first true science-fantasy works.[34][35] Isaac Asimov and Carl Sagan considered Somnium the first science-fiction story; it depicts a journey to the Moon and how the Earth's motion is seen from there.[36][37] <>
Following the 17th-century development of the novel as a literary form, Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (1818) and The Last Man (1826) helped define the form of the science-fiction novel. Brian Aldiss has argued that Frankenstein was the first work of science fiction.[38][39] Edgar Allan Poe wrote several stories considered to be science fiction, including "The Unparalleled Adventure of One Hans Pfaall" (1835) which featured a trip to the Moon.[40][41] Jules Verne was noted for his attention to detail and scientific accuracy, especially in Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (1870).[42][43][44][45] In 1887, the novel El anacronópete by Spanish author Enrique Gaspar y Rimbau introduced the first time machine.[46][47] A rather unknown early French/Belgian science fiction writer was J.-H. Rosny aîné (1856–1940).[48]
Many critics consider H. G. Wells one of science fiction's most important authors,[42][49] or even "the Shakespeare of science fiction."[50] His notable science-fiction works include The Time Machine (1895), The Island of Doctor Moreau (1896), The Invisible Man (1897), and The War of the Worlds (1898). His science fiction imagined alien invasion, biological engineering, invisibility, and time travel. In his non-fiction futurologist works he predicted the advent of airplanes, military tanks, nuclear weapons, satellite television, space travel, and something resembling the World Wide Web.[51] <>

Edgar Rice Burroughs' A Princess of Mars, published in 1912, was the first of his three-decade-long planetary romance series of Barsoom novels which were set on Mars and featured John Carter as the hero.[52] In 1926, Hugo Gernsback published the first American science-fiction magazine, Amazing Stories. In its first issue he wrote:
By 'scientifiction' I mean the Jules Verne, H. G. Wells and Edgar Allan Poe type of story—a charming romance intermingled with scientific fact and prophetic vision... Not only do these amazing tales make tremendously interesting reading—they are always instructive. They supply knowledge... in a very palatable form... New adventures pictured for us in the scientifiction of today are not at all impossible of realization tomorrow... Many great science stories destined to be of historical interest are still to be written... Posterity will point to them as having blazed a new trail, not only in literature and fiction, but progress as well.[53][54][55]
In 1928, E. E. "Doc" Smith's first published work, The Skylark of Space, written in collaboration with Lee Hawkins Garby, appeared in Amazing Stories. It is often called the first great space opera.[56] The same year, Philip Francis Nowlan's original Buck Rogers story, Armageddon 2419, also appeared in Amazing Stories. This was followed by a Buck Rogers comic strip, the first serious science-fiction comic.[57]
In 1937, John W. Campbell became editor of Astounding Science Fiction, an event which is sometimes considered the beginning of the Golden Age of Science Fiction, which is characterized by stories celebrating scientific achievement and progress.[58] In 1942, Isaac Asimov started his Foundation series, which chronicles the rise and fall of galactic empires and introduced psychohistory.[59][60] The series was later awarded a one-time Hugo Award for "Best All-Time Series."[61][62] The "Golden Age" is often said to have ended in 1946, but sometimes the late 1940s and the 1950s are included.[63]
Theodore Sturgeon's More Than Human (1953) explored possible future human evolution.[64][65][66] In 1957, Andromeda: A Space-Age Tale by the Russian writer and paleontologist Ivan Yefremov presented a view of a future interstellar communist civilization and is considered one of the most important Soviet science fiction novels.[67][68] In 1959, Robert A. Heinlein's Starship Troopers marked a departure from his earlier juvenile stories and novels.[69] It is one of the first and most influential examples of military science fiction,[70][71] and introduced the concept of powered armor exoskeletons.[72][73][74] The German space opera series Perry Rhodan, written by various authors, started in 1961 with an account of the first Moon landing[75] and has since expanded in space to multiple universes, and in time by billions of years.[76] It has become the most popular science fiction book series of all time.[77]
In the 1960s and 1970s, New Wave science fiction was known for its embrace of a high degree of experimentation, both in form and in content, and a highbrow and self-consciously "literary" or "artistic" sensibility.[34][78][79] In 1961, Solaris by Stanisław Lem was published in Poland.[80] The novel dealt with the theme of human limitations as its characters attempted to study a seemingly intelligent ocean on a newly discovered planet.[81][82] 1965's Dune by Frank Herbert featured a much more complex and detailed imagined future society than had previous science fiction.[83]
In 1967 Anne McCaffrey began her Dragonriders of Pern science fantasy series.[84] Two of the novellas included in the first novel, Dragonflight, made McCaffrey the first woman to win a Hugo or Nebula Award.[85] In 1968, Philip K. Dick's Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?, was published. It is the literary source of the Blade Runner movie franchise.[86][87] 1969's The Left Hand of Darkness by Ursula K. Le Guin was set on a planet in which the inhabitants have no fixed gender. It is one of the most influential examples of social science fiction, feminist science fiction, and anthropological science fiction.[88][89][90]
In 1979, Science Fiction World began publication in the People's Republic of China.[91] It dominates the Chinese science fiction magazine market, at one time claiming a circulation of 300,000 copies per issue and an estimated 3–5 readers per copy (giving it a total estimated readership of at least 1 million), making it the world's most popular science fiction periodical.[92] In 1984, William Gibson's first novel, Neuromancer, helped popularize cyberpunk and the word "cyberspace," a term he originally coined in his 1982 short story Burning Chrome.[93][94][95] In 1986, Shards of Honor by Lois McMaster Bujold began her Vorkosigan Saga.[96][97] 1992's Snow Crash by Neal Stephenson predicted immense social upheaval due to the information revolution.[98]
In 2007, Liu Cixin's novel, The Three-Body Problem, was published in China. It was translated into English by Ken Liu and published by Tor Books in 2014,[99] and won the 2015 Hugo Award for Best Novel,[100] making Liu the first Asian writer to win the award.[101]
Emerging themes in late 20th and early 21st century science fiction include environmental issues, the implications of the Internet and the expanding information universe, questions about biotechnology, nanotechnology, and post-scarcity societies.[102][103] Recent trends and subgenres include steampunk,[104] biopunk,[105][106] and mundane science fiction.[107][108]<>

In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. 2 Now the earth was formless and empty, darkness was over the surface of the deep, and the Spirit of God was hovering over the waters.
3 And God said, “Let there be light,” and there was light. 4 God saw that the light was good, and he separated the light from the darkness. 5 God called the light “day,” and the darkness he called “night.” And there was evening, and there was morning—the first day.
6 And God said, “Let there be a vault between the waters to separate water from water.” 7 So God made the vault and separated the water under the vault from the water above it. And it was so. 8 God called the vault “sky.” And there was evening, and there was morning—the second day.
9 And God said, “Let the water under the sky be gathered to one place, and let dry ground appear.” And it was so. 10 God called the dry ground “land,” and the gathered waters he called “seas.” And God saw that it was good.
11 Then God said, “Let the land produce vegetation: seed-bearing plants and trees on the land that bear fruit with seed in it, according to their various kinds.” And it was so. 12 The land produced vegetation: plants bearing seed according to their kinds and trees bearing fruit with seed in it according to their kinds. And God saw that it was good. 13 And there was evening, and there was morning—the third day.
14 And God said, “Let there be lights in the vault of the sky to separate the day from the night, and let them serve as signs to mark sacred times, and days and years, 15 and let them be lights in the vault of the sky to give light on the earth.” And it was so. 16 God made two great lights—the greater light to govern the day and the lesser light to govern the night. He also made the stars. 17 God set them in the vault of the sky to give light on the earth, 18 to govern the day and the night, and to separate light from darkness. And God saw that it was good. 19 And there was evening, and there was morning—the fourth day.
20 And God said, “Let the water teem with living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth across the vault of the sky.” 21 So God created the great creatures of the sea and every living thing with which the water teems and that moves about in it, according to their kinds, and every winged bird according to its kind. And God saw that it was good. 22 God blessed them and said, “Be fruitful and increase in number and fill the water in the seas, and let the birds increase on the earth.” 23 And there was evening, and there was morning—the fifth day.
24 And God said, “Let the land produce living creatures according to their kinds: the livestock, the creatures that move along the ground, and the wild animals, each according to its kind.” And it was so. 25 God made the wild animals according to their kinds, the livestock according to their kinds, and all the creatures that move along the ground according to their kinds. And God saw that it was good.
26 Then God said, “Let us make mankind in our image, in our likeness, so that they may rule over the fish in the sea and the birds in the sky, over the livestock and all the wild animals,[a] and over all the creatures that move along the ground.”
27 So God created mankind in his own image,
    in the image of God he created them;
    male and female he created them.
28 God blessed them and said to them, “Be fruitful and increase in number; fill the earth and subdue it. Rule over the fish in the sea and the birds in the sky and over every living creature that moves on the ground.”
29 Then God said, “I give you every seed-bearing plant on the face of the whole earth and every tree that has fruit with seed in it. They will be yours for food. 30 And to all the beasts of the earth and all the birds in the sky and all the creatures that move along the ground—everything that has the breath of life in it—I give every green plant for food.” And it was so.
31 God saw all that he had made, and it was very good. And there was evening, and there was morning—the sixth day.<>

Biden ran unsuccessfully for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1988 and 2008. He was the fourth-most senior sitting senator when he became Obama's vice president after they won the 2008 presidential election. Obama and Biden were reelected in 2012. During his two terms as vice president, Biden leaned on his Senate experience and frequently represented the administration in negotiations with congressional Republicans. He also oversaw infrastructure spending in 2009 to counteract the Great Recession. On foreign policy, Biden was a close counselor to President Obama and took a leading role in designing the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq in 2011.
Biden and his running mate, Kamala Harris, defeated incumbent Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential election. Upon inauguration, he became the oldest president in U.S. history and the first to have a female vice president. Biden signed the American Rescue Plan Act to help the U.S. recover from the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent recession. He proposed the American Jobs Plan, aspects of which were incorporated into the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. He proposed the American Families Plan, which was merged with other aspects of the American Jobs Plan into the proposed Build Back Better Act. After facing opposition in the Senate, the Build Back Better Act's size was reduced and it was comprehensively reworked into the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, covering deficit reduction, climate change, healthcare, and tax reform. Biden appointed Ketanji Brown Jackson to the Supreme Court. In foreign policy, he restored the U.S. into the Paris Agreement on climate change. He completed the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan, during which the Afghan government collapsed and the Taliban seized control. He responded to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine by imposing sanctions on Russia and authorizing foreign aid and weapons shipments to Ukraine.<>

After graduating from law school, Biden returned to Delaware to work as an attorney before quickly turning to politics, serving on the New Castle county council from 1970 to 1972. He was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1972 at the age of 29, becoming the fifth youngest senator in history. About a month later his wife and infant daughter were killed in a car accident, and his two sons were seriously injured. Although he contemplated suspending his political career, Biden was persuaded to join the Senate in 1973, and he went on to win reelection six times, becoming Delaware’s longest-serving senator. In 1977 he married Jill Jacobs, an educator, and they later had a daughter. In addition to his role as U.S. senator, Biden also was an adjunct professor (1991–2008) at the Wilmington, Delaware, branch of the Widener University School of Law.

As a senator, Biden focused on foreign relations, criminal justice, and drug policy. He served on the Senate’s Foreign Relations Committee, twice as its chair (2001–03; 2007–09), and on the Committee on the Judiciary, serving as its chair from 1987 to 1995. He was particularly outspoken on issues related to the Kosovo conflict of the late ’90s, urging U.S. action against Serbian forces to protect Kosovars against an offensive by Serbian Pres. Slobodan Milošević. On the Iraq War (2003–11), Biden proposed a partition plan as a way to maintain a united, peaceful Iraq. Biden also was a member of the International Narcotics Control Caucus and was the lead senator in writing the law that established the office of “drug czar,” a position that oversees the national drug-control policy.<>

On the page, Stephen King’s The Stand (1978) is a study in horrifying momentum. It’s so propulsive that King was able to add hundreds of pages 12 years after its original publication without sacrificing the celerity of a narrative that keeps moving from one climax — a burgeoning plague, humanity mobilizing in Boulder, the final stand — to another. It’s generally clear, and it’s always churning along.
CBS All Access’ new adaptation of The Stand is a car on cinderblocks. It looks great. If you glance under the hood, you can see all of the work that’s been done on the engine. But no matter how ready it seems to peel out onto the road, it isn’t going anywhere. Very rarely is the Benjamin Cavell-steered adaptation, with Josh Boone directing the pilot, actively bad, but it’s very frustrating. <>

This adaptation begins in medias res in Boulder, Colorado, with a team of volunteers clearing bodies out of a church — bodies crawling with maggots and grotesquely bloated in the face and neck. From that point, we flash back to an introduction to our main characters and then the spreading military-spawned virus known as Captain Trips. It’s a respiratory ailment that you know is about to decimate the population because every time there’s a group scene in the flashbacks, somebody edited in a handful of dry coughs just for ambiance.
In Maine, we meet quintessential girl-next-door Frannie (Odessa Young) and vaguely repellent narcissist Harold Lauder (Owen Teague), who has an unrequited crush on her (she is his former babysitter).
Initially in Texas, we meet Stu Redman (James Marsden), survivor of a shocking accident pivotal to the proliferation of Captain Trips. He eventually crosses paths with former sociology professor Glen (Greg Kinnear).
On the cusp of musical stardom in New York City, singer Larry Underwood (Jovan Adepo) begins a cross-country migration, one that will eventually bring him together with Nadine (Amber Heard) and the mysterious child they call Joe (Gordon Cormier).
At a hillbilly bar somewhere, we meet deaf-mute Nick (Henry Zaga), who crosses paths with Tom Cullen (Brad William Henke), who is developmentally disabled. <>

A tale of archetypal heroes and sweeping adventures, of dragons and princes and evil wizards--as only Stephen King can tell it!
The passage through the castle is dim, sensed by few and walked by only one. Flagg knows the way well. In four hundred years, he has walked it many times, in many guises, but now the passage serves its true purpose. Through the spyhole it conceals, the court magician observes King Roland--old, weak, yet still a king. Roland's time is nearly over, though, and young Prince Peter, tall and handsome, the measure of a king in all ways, stands to inherit the realm.
Yet a tiny mouse is enough to bring him down, a mouse that chances upon a grain of Dragon Sand behind Peter's shelves and
dies crying tears of fire and belching gray smoke. A mouse that dies as King Roland does. Flagg saw it all and smiled, for now Prince Thomas, a young boy easily swayed to Flagg's own purposes, would rule the kingdom. But Thomas has a secret that has turned his days into nightmares and his nights into prayed-for oblivion. The last bastion of hope lies at the top of the Needle, the royal prison where Peter plans a daring escape . . .
Writing with the wit and power that have enthralled millions, Stephen King has taken the classic fairy-tale form and transformed it into a masterpiece of fiction that will captivate readers of all ages. <>

Once upon a time, in the Kingdom of Delain, King Roland is murdered and his son and heir, Peter, is framed for the crime. Peter and his loyal friends must battle an evil wizard and Peter's usurper brother, Thomas, for the throne. Imprisoned in a tower, Peter conceives an escape plan that will take him years to execute before taking on Flagg, the powerful sorcerer who has masterminded this coup.<>
I think that real friendship always makes us feel such sweet gratitude, because the world almost always seems like a very hard desert, and the flowers that grow there seem to grow against such high odds.<>

Liesel and Hans Huberman have a friendship that make it possible for Liesel to get through bulling at school, abuse from her adopted mother, and the death of her brother. Friends are an important thing to have. They can help each other get through a tough time, whenever and wherever you need them. Liesel mailed a letter to her mom by using money she was not allowed to use. Once her adopted mother realized this, she hit her and after this she realized that she will never see her real mother again. This broke her but Hans Huberman helped her to recover, “For nearly an hour, she remained, spread out under the kitchen table, till Papa came home and played the accordion. Only then did she sit up and start to recover” (Zusak 99). The author wants us to realize that friendship is necessary. We can also see what the opposite of friendship looks like. The mother was aggravated by everyone she meets, including Liesel also Rosa Huberman had no love for her adopted daughter at all. (Zusak 35). This shows the contrast of Han and make Han’s relationship with Liesel even more apparent. If Rosa were nice to Liesel the dynamic of Liesel and Han would have been completely different. Han is one of the few that is nice to Liesel and without him Liesel would have had a grim time with no one to turn to when in need of help. Friendship can make someone enjoy life even when that person has gone through so much pain and sadness. <>

Flagg (Old Norse A sod of peat) [1] is a small Peak District village and civil parish, set in the Derbyshire Dales, halfway between the small market town of Bakewell and the spa town of Buxton, in the area known as the White Peak. The population of the civil parish as taken at the 2011 Census was 192.[2]
Flagg is predominantly a farming village. As well as farms, houses and cottages, Flagg has an Elizabethan manor house, Flagg Hall, which is not open to the public. There is a caravan/campsite within its grounds. The former Unitarian church, built in 1838, is now a private dwelling. A Methodist chapel is also situated in the village. It was completed in 1839. Next to the chapel is the former village school, now a nursery school.
1000 feet above sea level, Flagg is recorded in the Domesday Book as "Flagun", and is believed to have originally been a Viking settlement engaged primarily in lead mining, the evidence of which can still be seen today with many spoil heaps and disused mine shafts in the area. In the mid-19th century, well dressings were held during "Wakes Week", which was always begun on the first Sunday after June 24. There were two wells, one opposite to Ivy House Farm, and the other opposite to Edge Close Farm.
Flagg is known for the point-to-point races held annually on Easter Tuesday by the High Peak Hunt. On one occasion, King Edward VIII, the then Prince of Wales, rode at the races. The village is also popular with hikers and campers, having numerous walks within or close to its boundaries, and several campsites catering for tents, caravans, and motorhomes.<>
Stevie Wonder performs at the Rainbow Theatre, London, January 28, 1974. (Photo by Michael Putland/Getty Images).
Stevie Wonder is heading out on a short tour that will bring him to Madison Square Garden on November 6, performing his landmark classic album, Songs in the Key of Life, from start to finish.
The album is an emotional juggernaut, an immensely generous gift from the heart of a genius, and a masterpiece by almost any measure. Mr. Wonder set forth to cover the breadth suggested by the album’s title, nothing less than the “key of life.” And if he did not quite hit it all, his aim was true. It was the culmination of a four-album run (astonishingly released in just a 39-month timeframe) of sustained excellence unmatched aside from the Mt. Rushmore of 1960s-1970s giants of popular music—the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, Bob Dylan and maybe Van Morrison. Over the course of the sprawling record, two full-length LPs and a four-song 7-inch EP, he makes nary a misstep. From the musical compositions, to the lyrics, astonishing performances and sterling production, it has to be counted as one of the greatest records of all time. If simply judged as an album of vocal performances, I can think of none better. Here is one of the greatest singers of the 20th and 21st centuries at the prime of his abilities, commanding our attention for 22 songs spread over three slabs on vinyl.
Retailing for $13.98 in 1976, it was a gargantuan hit record, debuting at No. 1 on the Billboard Pop Albums chart. It spent 13 weeks at No. 1 and 35 weeks in the Top 10, yielding four Billboard Top 40 singles, two of which went to No. 1. It was the first album released under Mr. Wonder’s staggering new seven-year, $37 million contract with Motown Records.
I was 10 when it came out and after being swept away by the unrelenting groove of the single, “I Wish,” I marched right down to the record store and plopped down my allowance money. It was the first album I bought on my own. I knew Stevie Wonder’s music already from the radio. Funky singles like “Superstition,” “Higher Ground” and “Boogie on Reggae Women” were all big hits. As the oldest kid in my Long Island family, AM radio was my main exposure to music in the early 1970s. I had already amassed a collection of Top 40 singles I had purchased, plus some key LPs and ’60s singles I had inherited from neighbors. But “I Wish,” a song by a 26-year-old man waxing nostalgic for the time when he was the age I was right then, propelled me to commit to my first significant musical investment. I wanted that record like most of my friends coveted a 10-speed bike.
I think if I had been my adult self and bought the record on the basis of the hard R&B heard on “I Wish,” I would be initially let down by how the album opens, enigmatically on a kind of mellow note. As a kid, though, my mind was open. In fact, while I loved those funk-infused singles, I was also a big fan of Stevie’s smooth ballads. “You Are the Sunshine of My Life” and “My Cherie Amour,” also spoke to me. That chorus change of “My Cherie Amour” (“Oh Cherie Amour, pretty little one that I adore…”) in particular buckled my knees.
Here are some of my personal faves, the songs that are the most representative of the album and those I most look forward to hearing performed live:
Love’s in Need of Love Today
Songs in the Key of Life opens with a rich a cappella ensemble of male voices introducing “Love’s in Need of Love Today,” which could be all layered overdubs from Stevie. It’s hard to tell. While the album came with a 24-page booklet with lyrics and liner notes, with an extensive personnel list—and a gratitude page that nods to everyone from Kareem Abdul Jabaar, to David Bowie, on down to Frank Zappa—the credits listing who does what on each song is as haphazard as the Rolling Stones’ Exile on Main Street. Mr. Wonder, though, plays much of the instrumentation on the album himself, including drums, and is surrounded by a core band that forms the backbone of the album. The stellar bass player, Nathan Watts, is a standout among an impressive group, and remains a steady sideman with Mr. Wonder to this day.
You don’t want it to end. It takes you by surprise. You thought the guy was just warming up. He is already out-singing anyone you have ever heard.
Mr. Wonder enters softly, “Good morn or evening friends/Here’s your friendly announcer.” All at once, we get a glimpse of some of the strengths and perhaps one of the few faults in the record. We get the warmth and a bit of the humor that remain themes throughout the record. But we also have a bit of the clumsy syntax that peppers the text of the songs. Stevie is one of those songwriters who will make an end run—at times, more like a flea-flicker double reverse—to complete a rhyme. In that regard, he is less like Cole Porter and more like Bob Dylan and who can complain about that? Like Mr. Dylan, the words are submissive to the master rhythm. So consistently does Mr. Wonder reimagine syllabic accents and leave us hanging on rhymes, that it appears to be by design and has become a lovable trademark of sorts.
The song’s message is simple. The Beatles sang that “all you need is love.” Ten years later, here is a dire warning that love itself is in need of love. In the voice of a broadcast news anchor, it serves as a perfect introduction to the album, which in addition to intimate moments, offers a wide-lens view of the state of the world during the mid-1970s, subject matter as broadly ambitious as the extensive scope of musical styles it contains.
The sonics, the warmth of the track itself, draws you in. You surrender yourself to the overall sound, rich and with a crisp presence. But then you also get all this ear candy put together like Brian Wilson’s layered work for the Beach Boys. It’s a classic headphone record, with perfectly placed percussion and thoughtful overdubs.
The song stays fairly restrained for the bulk of the arrangement. But as with many songs on the album, Mr. Wonder adds an improvised vamp over a repeated chorus ad-libbing with a call-and-response gospel style. His vocal starts to climb up in octaves. The slow-burn arrangement takes on a new layer of excitement, then another. Before you know it, you are completely swept up in it. The trust you showed in Stevie Wonder when you went and plopped down $14 on the LP based on “I Wish” turned out to be well placed.
“Love’s in Need of Love Today” goes on for over seven minutes. And you don’t want it to end. It takes you by surprise. You thought the guy was just warming up. He is already out-singing anyone you have ever heard. Inspired singing. Technically brilliant singing.
Village Ghetto Land
The Beatles are as much an influence on the album as Sly Stone, Curtis Mayfield and Marvin Gaye. And not just in scope and ambition, but musically speaking as well. Indeed, “Sir Duke” sounds like it could have been written by Paul McCartney, and the Hare Krishnas who sing on the song “Pastime Paradise” is an idea out of the George Harrison playbook. “Village Ghetto Land” is a sort of 1970s synth “Eleanor Rigby.”
Herbie Hancock, who played on the song “As,” says he admired Stevie’s “orchestral use of synthesizers … Stevie doesn’t fall into the trap that I do” in trying to duplicate the sounds of acoustic strings. “Stevie lets the synths be what they are, something that’s not acoustic.” These parts, from an ARP synthesizer, sound just enough like strings to let you know the faux minuet vibe is satirical, a tip-toe tour across the typical 1970s American urban ghetto. The lyric was written by Gary Byrd, who spent months on it only to have Wonder call him during the recording with the urgent need for a new verse, which Mr. Byrd provided in about 20 minutes. The song is directed at out-of-touch, and presumably white, fellow citizens who look the other way or even disparage the poor. “Some folks say we should be glad for what we have.’” Meanwhile, families eat dog food while “politicians laugh and drink, drunk to all demands.”
Mr. Wonder takes us off the course set by the first two songs. “Loves in Need of Love Today” contains a warning but is ultimately a hopeful message that we can turn around “the force of evil plans.” The groovy slow funk song, “Have a Talk with God,” offers one source of that hope via devotional faith. “Village Ghetto Land” has a bite, though. It is not a Dylan-esque finger-pointing personal indictment; Mr. Wonder and Mr. Byrd merely offer a realistic litany of what life is like in America’s urban ghettos during a particularly low ebb for the country’s cities. It asks simply, if not naively, “Tell me, would you be happy in Village Ghetto Land?”
Sir Duke
The track that leads into “Sir Duke,” the fusion workout “Contusion,” was about the new direction jazz was taking in the 1970s. “Sir Duke,” though, is a direct tribute to the “pioneers that time will not allow us to forget.” Mr. Wonder had started the album around the time of Duke Ellington’s 1974 death. The song was the second single off the album and a second No. 1 smash.
A blast of brass opens the song with the riff that serves as the first of three main hooks. As a pop-jazz number, it reaches back to the early days of the big band era, with a jaunty 1930s-era hot jazz rhythm, something along the lines of “Diminuendo in Blue,” rather than the sexy languid swing heard on, say, “Jeep’s Blues,” both of which can be heard on Ellington’s big comeback record, Live at Newport 1956. The throwback vibe and the soaring melody of the chorus line “you can feel it all over” (the second hook) has Paul “Your Mother Should Know” McCartney written all over it. But the third hook of the song, which comes with the breakdown and syncopated bass, brass, keyboard and guitar lines also tips to the modern influence Earth, Wind & Fire was having on Mr. Wonder. At the time of the recording, that band was reaching its zenith with effervescent horn-driven pop-flavored R&B recordings like this one. “Sir Duke” is a remarkable ensemble arrangement, which makes it even more astounding to notice how Nathan Watts stands out with a staggering bass part. If you think you’ve heard the song enough, try listening one more time with your headphones while concentrating on the bass.
We also get more than a small bit of Stevie’s color-blind philosophy. This is not some pedantic lesson in the significance of African-Americans’ contributions to American music meant to induce guilt (as maybe “Village Ghetto Land” is); it is a celebration of all—white, jewish, black, male and female—who have helped build that quintessentially American art form of jazz.
I Wish
Eric Clapton said in 1974 that Stevie Wonder is “the greatest drummer of our time.” As music journalist Eric Sandler rightly points out, this was “hefty praise coming from a man who played with Ginger Baker.” A true musical prodigy, Stevie had become proficient on drums, piano and harmonica by the age of 9. By his late teens, he was not only a pop star himself, but he was writing and producing for others, including “It’s a Shame” for the Spinners, on which he plays the delicious drum groove himself. (Here is the backing track without vocals.)
“I Wish” is unmistakably a Stevie Wonder drum pattern. Aside from having an innate sense of groove, there is a musical inventiveness that might stem from being a well-rounded multi-instrumentalist, as opposed to someone who strictly defines themselves as a drummer. There is a consistent thread that runs from that Spinners track, through “Superstition,” and can be heard yet again on “I Wish”; a trademark Wonder bouncy beat. It has something to do with the way Mr. Wonder works the hi-hat cymbals. On “I Wish,” for example, notice how on the doo-wop-influenced post-chorus breakdown, he opens and closes the hi-hat in a wholly unexpected and unorthodox way, creating a rhythmic hook under the actual melodic hook. And that hi-hat gloss is there right from the top of the track. While the kick and snare drum beat asserts itself as the backbone of the track, the flossy triplets and accents he plays on the hi-hat, so prominent in the mix, is the excited heartbeat that makes our own pulses race.
Which brings us to that groove, one of the most famous in funk. As a musical colloquialism, “groove” is hard to define but we know it when we hear it. A groove is achieved when a drummer lays back in a rhythmic pocket and keeps the band from letting excitement mess with the tempo that was set at the top of the track. It provides a comfortable and predictable spot for the ensemble, knowing they can lean into the beat, or back away from it as musical choice, as in the jazz-coined term, “swing.”
On “I Wish,” as demonstrated in the Classic Albums documentary about the album, Stevie started the recording on the Fender Rhodes electric piano, which is the instrument on which he started almost all the songs on the album. His left hand played the continuous walking bass line, which was later doubled and embellished with growling slides by bass guitarist Nathan Watts. Then Mr. Wonder went in and laid down that drum track, followed shortly by what sounds like pizzicato chicken-scratching guitar parts, which are actually two competing synth parts playing countermelodies.
It’s an infectious, badass track that’s made even badder by a hard-hitting brass attack. Mr. Wonder spins a nostalgic lyric that’s at once witty and poignant. Can we still laugh at a line like “Trying your best to bring the water to your eyes/Thinking it might stop her from whooping your behind/I wish those days could come back once more/Why did those days ever have to go?” If not, we can still smile at the famous “Smoking cigarettes and writing something nasty on the wall,” followed by Mr. Wonder’s own sister, Renee Hardaway’s admonishing answer “You nasty boy!” And many of us recall the same reply we made to younger siblings who claimed they were going to tell on us: “Just don’t tell I’ll give you anything you want in this whole wide world.”
Mr. Wonder recorded the song the day after a Motown picnic. The label and studio served as a sort of middle school and high school for the boy genius, which might partially explain the wistful look back at his childhood.
Pastime Paradise
Mr. Wonder built this track up from a prototype polyphonic (ability to play multiple keys/notes simultaneously) Yamaha synthesizer, which he dubbed “the Dream Machine.” Gary Olazabal, who was one of the main engineers on the record told SoundonSound.com that Mr. Wonder was interested in using equipment that nobody else had. “Stevie’s still trying to get the next new thing,” he says. “He’s just like a kid that way.”
It is important to understand that this was still the very early days of synthesizers. Analog synthesizer sounds, pioneered by the Moog company, were first starting to be heard on popular records around the time of the Beatles’ “Here Comes the Sun.” But the technology that enabled fairly reasonable facsimiles of acoustic sounds like strings was still in its nascent stage. Digital technology would revolutionize it even further, but that was years away. With tracks like “Pastime Paradise,” Mr. Wonder was blowing our minds as we strapped on Radio Shack headphones in our parents’ living rooms in the same way the Beatles did a decade earlier for slightly older music fans.
It is easy to take a track like “Pastime Paradise” for granted now, when any kid with Garage Band can quickly dial up a wide variety of sonic textures. And yet rapper Coolio lifted the whole track as a sample to form his own variation of the song with the hit “Gangsta’s Paradise” in 1995, long after the digital tools were available to easily create new sounds. In 1975, to even achieve something as simple as the reverse gong sound that opens the track meant cueing up a reel of tape, turning it over, and meticulously locating just the right spot—just as Mr. Wonder starts to sing the first line—to drop the sound into what would make up the final master. A few years later, the same trick would literally be a push of a button.
In the Classic Albums documentary, Mr. Wonder points to “the whole Earth, Wind & Fire groove that was happening back then,” as an influence. He illustrates it by tapping out a rhythm that sounds like the band’s “Can’t Hide Love” from 1975, the year Mr. Wonder was in the thick of recording the album. The tension of the “Pastime Paradise,” ratcheted up by Afro-Cuban percussion and Hare Krishna bells, reaches an apotheosis when a chanting Krishna chorus, literally brought in off the streets, meshes with a gospel choir singing “We Shall Overcome.”
The title is a play on words about being trapped in false nostalgia and not facing the harsh realities of the present. While one might reasonably ask if that is not what Mr. Wonder himself does with “I Wish” and “Sir Duke” from the same album—after all, wasn’t he “living in some pastime paradise” in the amber of nostalgia, where even “whoopin’ [his] behind” was recalled wistfully?—it is a matter of application.
Sure, we all enjoy looking back. But a few years before the election of President Ronald “It’s Morning Again in America” Reagan, “Pasttime Paradise” warns of political manipulation of such sentimentality. “Glorifying days long gone behind/They’ve been wasting most their days in remembrance of ignorance…” While Southerners looking fondly back at the time of segregation are one target here, Mr. Wonder also takes a swipe at those who are so faithful that they accept living in poor conditions with some future promise of salvation.
Though the song takes on some hefty subjects in its lyric, Mr. Wonder gets a bit bogged down in the litany of “-tion” words, as Bono would a decade later. “I remember, when he was writing that song in the studio, he was struggling to come up with all of those ‘-tion’ words like ‘dissipation,’ ‘segregation,’ ‘exploitation,’ ” engineer Mr. Olazabal said. “He was trying to come up with enough of those lyrics that would actually mean something and make sense.”
Ordinary Pain
The next song, “Summer Soft,” serves as a breezy antidote to “Pastime Paradise” and the light mood continues into the next song of the album, “Ordinary Pain.” But it is a short-lived respite. This Al Green-flavored song starts with the voice of Stevie-as-naif, continuing the “Songs of Innocence” thread of the album, which can be divided along the lines of William Blake’s Songs of Innocence and of Experience. The melancholy tune that forms the first part of the two-part “Ordinary Pain” suite is not without its humor. The truly Wonderously phrased “Tell her you’re glad/It’s over in fact/Can she take with her the pain she brought back” is perhaps his most gymnastic maneuver to finish a rhyme.
What makes such musical moments so effective? If we could explain it, would we need music? It’s the music itself that goes beyond what words alone can articulate.
But this ambling hangdog “woman done me wrong” tale takes a harsh turn for its he said/she said second part. As the bittersweet loping first half peters out, listen for how Stevie adds ever-darker descending bass notes on his electric piano, ending on a dissonant note that launches into the hard funk of the second section. Leading a call-and-answer female Greek choir of sorts, Shirley Brewer lashes out with a rebuttal to the woe-is-me narrator of the first song, opening with the blunt “You’re just a masochistic fool/I thought you knew my love was cruel.” With that line, Mr. Wonder’s self-awareness is laid bare. The idealistic worldview he has presented thus far on the album comes from an imperfect narrator. Ms. Brewer slaps him out of his hazy daze.
Two can play a game of cruel love. Now that we hear her counterpoint, we think, Well, hmmm. Maybe he wasn’t such a good boy after all. Ms. Brewer’s character rails at a few offenses that the Stevie character is responsible for: “You’re crying big crocodile tears/To match the ones I cried for years/When I was home waiting for you/You were out somewhere doin’ the do.” She drives the nail in hard with the line “I knew our love would have to end/The night I made it with your friend.” I was afraid of her voice when I was 10.
Ms. Brewer’s point of view is one of empowerment, backed up by a sisterhood chorus consisting of Linda Lawrence, Terri Hendricks, Sundray Tucker, Charity McCrary and Madelaine Jones, a hard-R&B-type backing part in the tradition of the Ikettes and LaBelle. On a record with some great 1970s funk, the beefy synth-driven groove of part II of “Ordinary Pain” is a standout that hits hard, a link between later Sly Stone, Funkadelic, and—with the horn riffs over a heavy bottom—stuff that came in the next year or two, like the Commodores’ “Brick House.”
I have read or heard people who find this as a weak spot on the album. On the contrary, to me it forms a central linch pin, brilliantly encapsulating much of what makes the record so satisfying, the soft/hard/naive/bitter/innocence/experience/joy/pain themes all rolled into one song.
Isn’t She Lovely
When I was a kid, I would replay certain parts of some songs over and over, lifting the needle from my records and carefully placing it back down to listen again to a chord change, an inspired vocal, or a guitar solo. On “Isn’t She Lovely,” Stevie indulges those of us who want beloved songs to go on, comping the chord changes as he takes us to new planes of ecstasy with a chromatic harmonica (as opposed to blues harp) solo that soars past jazz harmonica virtuoso, Toots Thielemans, into Sonny Rollins territory. When the song became a popular album track for disc jockeys to spin, Mr. Wonder successfully resisted Motown’s pleas for a 45 RPM 7-inch single. But the version we most often hear on the radio is an edit that the label made. But too long? Please, son. That’s like telling Mr. Rollins, “Hey Saxophone Colossus! Rein it in a bit on ‘Tenor Madness.’ ”
Incidentally, I have just now discovered that Mr. Rollins recorded a cover of the song, something I honestly did not know before making the comparison. This makes sense. Mr. Wonder’s original recording has the sort of swinging buoyancy found in some of the more popular jazz albums that Mr. Rollins recorded. And aside from its length and some 1970s production techniques, “Isn’t She Lovely” sounds like the classic jazz-informed pop that epitomized 1960s Motown recordings, right down to the tambourine work. Stevie plays almost everything on the song, even the infectious bass parts played on a synth.
The lyric is unabashedly and literally life-affirming. Over intimate home recordings of his baby daughter, Aisha—who now appears in performances with him and whose birth the song celebrates—Mr. Wonder’s harmonica takes flight in one of the best displays in improvisation on record. It is not self-indulgent soloing; each phrase is memorable. Each round of comping reveals original new melodies. I can whistle or hum the whole thing, right on down to his flub (around 4:40) much to the dismay of my children on long car rides. But few songs can make you feel as good as this one. If you believe otherwise, you have a heart of coal, my friend.
As
The album proper finishes with two more Latin-tinged compositions, “As,” and the grand finale, “Another Star.” On the latter, Mr. Wonder finally acknowledges the four-on-the-floor beat and glossy sounds of the then-trendy disco music. It’s a fabulous dance workout, with a large ensemble of A-plus players such as George Benson. But for many listeners, “As” has to be counted as one of—if not the—finest song on the album and I am loath to disagree.
“As” is another one that sneaks in as if on a summer’s soft-rock breeze but ends up working us over with a hard emotional punch. A jazzy turnaround between verses yields briefly to a gospel choir, a mere foreshadowing for the vamp the ends the song. In the meantime, Mr. Wonder sings yet another summation of time’s passage, seasons and elemental forces of life: “Just as hate knows love’s the cure/You can rest your mind assured/That I’ll be loving you always.”
But it is again the outro where Stevie shines, a blend of samba and gospel that, in Stevie’s hands, is unquestionably natural. Of course you can blend all that shit! After a minute-long 24-bar respite, Mr. Wonder re-enters the song with a guttural bellow, as Sly Stone might, sounding like Big Bad Steve, not Little Stevie Wonder, with maybe the album’s greatest lyrical moment:
We all know sometimes life’s hates and troubles
Can make you wish you were born in another time and space
But you can bet your life times that and twice its double
That God knew exactly where he wanted you to be placed
So make sure when you say you’re in it but not of it
You’re not helping to make this earth a place sometimes called Hell
Change your words into truths and then change that truth into love
And maybe our children’s grandchildren and their great-great grandchildren will tell.
It is the album’s takeaway message. In all these decades, I’ve never listened to it without feeling the same knot of inspiration, catharsis and euphoria, as close to some vague belief that I have been healed by some divinity as I come.
Mr. Wonder ends the set with the much lighter “Another Star,” but for me, this is the climax and conclusion of the album. The rest is sweet desert.
Ebony Eyes
Somewhere along the line, my childhood collection of 45s vanished. Among them was the 7-inch “Something Extra” EP included in the Songs in the Key of Life album. It broke my heart that I could not find that record. For among those four songs on the EP was one of my personal eclectic favorites of the whole package, the song “Ebony Eyes.”
It seems that few people that love the album know this song. I think in the days on vinyl, the EP was presented as, and became an afterthought. Less than 10 years after I bought the album, I was in college, though, and we used to spend all night spinning discs, taking turns as dorm-room DJs. A friend of mine had a far more complete and far-less battered copy of Songs in the Key of Life and I immediately went for the EP and set the needle down on the New Orleans early piano funk throwback track, “Ebony Eyes,” which, from that point on became chief among our Saturday night rallying anthems.
Stevie channels Professor Longhair, with more than a bit of Allen Toussaint influence on the track. But with his mastery of the talkbox, which makes his synths, like Peter Frampton’s guitar, have a human-like enunciation. He trades solos with ace saxophonist Jim Horn, and there is a pedal steel part from Flying Burrito Brother, Peter “Sneaky Pete” Kleinow, each of who had played on records by the Rolling Stones, George Harrison and a huge list of others.
In Barry Levinson’s 1982 movie, Diner, the characters refer to good times, kicks, and even hot girls as “a smile.” “Ebony Eyes” is a musical smile. “She’s the sunflower of nature’s seed/A girl that some men only find in their dreams/When she smiles it seems the stars all know/‘Cause one by one they start to light up the sky.”
Knocks Me Off My Feet
I cannot imagine being one of those people who records songs at a show, never mind someone like this guy, who recorded the entire “Songs in the Key of Life” benefit performance in Los Angeles in December 2013. And I would hate to be the person seated behind him. But as someone who was unable to fly out to L.A. to witness the show in person, I am grateful that someone recorded it.
But now I am thrilled that Mr. Wonder decided to tour with the show. The last performance of his that I attended was an overwhelming experience, as he delved deep into his catalog. And I am preparing to be an emotional wreck again when I see the “Songs in the Key of Life” show. The music has been with me my whole listening life and, frankly, all it takes is one glass of wine for me to get weepy. But in the video of the L.A. performance, you will see Mr. Wonder himself welling up, seemingly unable to sing the chorus of “Knocks Me Off My Feet,” as the crowd takes over around the 49-50-minute mark.
What makes such musical moments so effective? If we could explain it, would we need music? It’s the music itself that goes beyond what words alone can articulate. There is the warm glow of nostalgia, not just the fact that everyone in the audience likely grew up with the album, but in the chords themselves. There is a familiarity to the changes that harkens back to “My Cherie Amour” and beyond, through bossa nova, jazz, and right on back to the standards of the 1940s. Over these warm piano parts—electric and acoustic—Stevie takes his melody from a simple verse, to a pre-chorus structure that contains its own step-up-and-down (literally illustrated with a staircase in the lyric booklet), to the soaring chorus. And it is taken to an even higher plane with the modulation of the key (around 2:40) for the final chorus.
Tension, release and ecstasy. It is a form he replicates throughout in the record with the same results, such as on the ultra-sensuous “Joy Inside My Tears,” which purrs with a surreal synth and brings Stevie to the most soulful vocal improvisations since “Uncle Ray” Charles. One of my great regrets in life is not going to see Ray Charles when he was still with us. You have to make every effort to go see the great ones. Stevie Wonder is one of the giants. He doesn’t perform often. I’ll be there this year.<>

Economy: What’s going to save us? The answer has always been obvious
The most disappointing feature of the most recent jobs report is that wages did not grow very much, even though the U.S. economy is at or near full employment. For 2019, wages grew at 2.9% — but, since inflation is about 2%, real wage growth is about 1%. That’s hardly impressive. The last decade was the second-slowest for payroll growth since the 1940s. What’s the solution? Subsidized healthcare, housing, and education. In some sense, that’s always been obvious. But in other senses, these are areas where we haven’t seen disruption the way we saw in technology. Let’s hope it’s not too late.
Neuroscience: Is there a limit to human capacity?
In my opinion, the most consequential revolution of this century will stem from startups that are trying to build neuroprosthetics: invasive and non-invasive devices that extend and improve our cognition. But first, why do we need this? Isn’t our brain the most complex machine already, with unlimited storage potential? No, it’s not. We have a finite, but large, capacity. Yet the amount of information we consume has skyrocketed in the past two decades.
Psychology: Healing trauma through the vagus nerve
I subscribed to Tiago Forte recently after I read about his initiative, Praxis. I obtained a newsletter cum article from him recently that was almost 8000 words long. Do I want to spend 30 minutes reading this? Sigh, let’s do it. I ended up reading it all the way till the end (and glancing through some parts quickly), and having a sense of profound feeling that I read something very special. The way he blended two chronologically asynchronous stories into one is worth noting.
Technology: Cash is the technology we can never replace
Think about the last time you used cash. How much did you spend? What did you buy, and from whom? Was it a one-time thing, or was it something you buy regularly? Was it legal?
If you’d rather keep all that to yourself, you’re in luck. The person in the store (or on the street corner) may remember your face, but as long as you didn’t reveal any identifying information, there is nothing that links you to the transaction. However, we’re walking into century that’s getting more ready to sing an elegy for this technology. <>

I looked around, trying to memorize all the little details around me. The tall crane that shimmers green at night, the naked and skeleton-like trees set at uneven distances, patches of snow on the ground. It was so quiet. I looked at the windows of the towering apartments, watching silhouettes move and TVs emit colorful light. And I thought, if tonight were my last on this planet, how would I spend it?
It’s a powerful question that I urge you all to ask yourselves once in a while. It tells you what you really yearn for, and care about.<>

"A film for a generation growing up without fairy tales."
―George Lucas[1]
Star Wars is a multi-genre mythology and multimedia franchise created by George Lucas in 1976. Comprising movies, novels, comics, video games, toys, and numerous television series, the Star Wars franchise employs archetypal motifs common to religions, classical mythology, and political climax, as well as musical motifs of those same aspects.
As one of the foremost examples of the space opera subgenre of science fiction, Star Wars has become part of mainstream popular culture, as well as being one of the highest-grossing series of all time.[2]
In 2012, The Walt Disney Company bought the rights to the franchise from George Lucas for 4.05 billion dollars. Since then, Disney has split off Star Wars into two main categories, those being Star Wars Legends and Star Wars Canon, with Canon being the "official" story of the franchise.
Despite the mainline story of the franchise, officially known as the Skywalker Saga, reaching its conclusion in 2019 with the release of Star Wars: Episode IX The Rise of Skywalker, the franchise is still going strong, mainly due to the success of the Disney+ original television series The Mandalorian, the final season of Star Wars: The Clone Wars and publishing projects such as Star Wars: The High Republic.<>

"THE SHADOW'S SHADOW'S SHADOW" An epic new story begins as DARTH VADER embarks upon a new mission in partnership with a sworn enemy – but who's leading whom to doom? And what happens when the QUEEN'S SHADOW learns the deepest secret of the Dark Lord of the Sith? Plus: the shocking return of a face from Vader's most distant past!<>

Playboy and visionary industrial genius Tony Stark, CEO of leading military defense contractor, Stark Industries, is in war-torn Kunar, Afghanistan, to demonstrate his company's new Jericho missile. With him is his friend and military liaison, Lieutenant Colonel James Rhodes, a member of the U.S. Air Force.
Tony Stark presenting the new Jericho missile
While riding in a transport convoy, Stark is critically wounded in an ambush and held captive in a cave by the Ten Rings. An electromagnet built by fellow captive Ho Yinsen keeps the shrapnel that wounded Stark from reaching his heart and killing him. The Ten Rings leader, Raza, offers Stark freedom; in exchange, Stark must build a Jericho missile for the terrorists. Stark and Yinsen agree that Raza will not keep his word of letting Stark live.
Tony Stark is fitted with the Mark I
While pretending to work on the missile, Stark and Yinsen secretly build a powerful electric generator called an Arc Reactor to power Stark's electromagnet. They then begin to build a powered suit of armor, designed by Stark, to help them escape. The Ten Rings ambush the workshop when they discover Stark's plan, but Yinsen sacrifices himself to distract them while Stark's suit powers up. Using the armored suit, Stark fights his way out of the cave to find a mortally wounded Yinsen, who reassures Stark and urges him to continue his escape and not waste his life. An enraged Stark leaves the cave, burns the terrorist's stockpile of Stark Industries-produced weapons, and flies away. Having escaped, Stark crashes in the desert, which destroys the suit. <>

Mikasa Ackermann recalls the Scout Regiment's first trip to Marley, where they had joyful moments such as discovering ice cream and connecting with refugees from the Marley Mid-East War, but also disappointments, in that the Subjects of Ymir Protection Group was not the ally the Scouts hoped they would be. That was when Eren Jaeger left the Scouts and began operating on his own, telling them that he would follow his brother Zeke's plan. Mikasa wonders if they could have made choices so things would have turned out differently.
Meanwhile, Eren recalls the events that had led him here; how he had met Yelena and learned of Zeke's euthanasia plan, how he had confided in Floch Forster that he would only pretend to go along with Zeke's plan when in reality he would use the rumbling to wipe out the rest of the world, and how he had tried and failed to persuade Historia Reiss to fight or flee before the Military Police turned her into a Titan to eat Zeke. A fleet of ships tries to stop Eren's army of Wall Titans, but fails, and his Titans finally arrive at Marley's shores.<>

Ah, how I could go on. For your sake however, I’ll try to condense it as best I can.
Star wars is that thing that always lingers in the back of a person’s mind, whether you’ve seen it or not, like the novels of Mark Twain or the music of Frank Sinatra, Star Wars is a piece of Americana that defines a lot of people from 1977 and up.
Star Wars began somewhere in the 30’s and 40’s, with the Flash Gordon serials, and the popularization of WW2’s dogfighting plane combat. It took inspiration from these, and many other things, including but not limited to:
Westerns such as Sergio Leone’s Fistful of Dollars
Eastern Films, such as Akira Kurosawa’s Seven Samurai
Religions like Buddhism and Christianity
Now that we have Star War’s inspiration, let’s see how it interpreted those things.
Imagine you’re in a theater in 1977. The lights go down, the movie starts, and you’re faced with this text:
A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away…
Already the tone is set, your anticipation rises until, bam! John William’s classic score hits you with full force as you’re introduced to this new universe through scrolling text. An evil empire, the heroic rebels, secret plans, a princess running to protect the fate of the galaxy.
It slows down and quiets, and the screen focuses on a planet. The beat of blockade runner draws our attention as a tiny rebel ship heading towards the orange planet is pursued by a humongous star destroyer. Instantly this evokes a feeling of pity as this tiny ship is overcome by this gargantuan triangular beast of a starship. Cutting to the inside of the ship, we see multiple rebels lining up in front of the airlock, preparing for enemy attack. A moment of tension as the door starts to smoke. The door opens and we are introduced to the enemy as the identical white armor of the empire’s stormtroopers barge in and ruthlessly slaughter the rebels. In the aftermath of the carnage, our main villain slowly walks in. A black cape billows behind him, this is Darth Vader, dark lord of the sith. A samurai in black leather, with a deep voice, and an intimidating breathing problem.
I won’t spoil any more, but this intro effectively introduces our villains as a force to be reckoned with.
Minutes later on the desert planet we saw before, we meet our hero: Luke Skywalker. A farm boy with a desire for purpose beyond his simple life.
Through a series of events sparked by a pair of robots, Luke meets Obi Wan Kenobi, a jedi knight that teaches him about a mysterious power that holds everything in the universe in balance. Obi Wan tells him of his father, and grants him his father’s weapon, the weapon of a jedi knight: the lightsaber.
Through a tragic event, Luke is spurred to follow Obi Wan on adventure to save the galaxy. They meet Han Solo, a smuggler on the run from bounty hunters, and his partner, a hairy humanoid alien named Chewbacca.
I couldn’t use examples without spoiling, but the aesthetic the original star wars trilogy uses is broken down and used, dusty and weathered. Within the first hour, you’re bombarded with so many different references to past events, aliens, characters who are only alluded to, and cool technologies that the universe feels far, far bigger than anything actually shown.
Other movies include family squabble, clones, exiles, romance, betrayal, teddy bears, robots, speeder bikes, lasers, one liners, and over all, action.
Star Wars is sword fights between friends turned enemies, Star Wars is the star ships flying through the sky locked in combat, Star Wars is the sense of dread our heroes feel when hundreds of imperial assault vehicles appear on the horizon, Star Wars is the thousands of different creatures and races populating a city as big as a planet, Star Wars is the peace found within the mystical powers of the force. Star Wars is all of this and more.
Star Wars is tragedy, adventure, and redemption.
That is Star Wars; and it’s everything I could want. <>

The Beginning
1 In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. 2 Now the earth was formless and empty, darkness was over the surface of the deep, and the Spirit of God was hovering over the waters.
3 And God said, “Let there be light,” and there was light. 4 God saw that the light was good, and he separated the light from the darkness. 5 God called the light “day,” and the darkness he called “night.” And there was evening, and there was morning—the first day.
6 And God said, “Let there be a vault between the waters to separate water from water.” 7 So God made the vault and separated the water under the vault from the water above it. And it was so. 8 God called the vault “sky.” And there was evening, and there was morning—the second day.
9 And God said, “Let the water under the sky be gathered to one place, and let dry ground appear.” And it was so. 10 God called the dry ground “land,” and the gathered waters he called “seas.” And God saw that it was good.
11 Then God said, “Let the land produce vegetation: seed-bearing plants and trees on the land that bear fruit with seed in it, according to their various kinds.” And it was so. 12 The land produced vegetation: plants bearing seed according to their kinds and trees bearing fruit with seed in it according to their kinds. And God saw that it was good. 13 And there was evening, and there was morning—the third day.
14 And God said, “Let there be lights in the vault of the sky to separate the day from the night, and let them serve as signs to mark sacred times, and days and years, 15 and let them be lights in the vault of the sky to give light on the earth.” And it was so. 16 God made two great lights—the greater light to govern the day and the lesser light to govern the night. He also made the stars. 17 God set them in the vault of the sky to give light on the earth, 18 to govern the day and the night, and to separate light from darkness. And God saw that it was good. 19 And there was evening, and there was morning—the fourth day.
20 And God said, “Let the water teem with living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth across the vault of the sky.” 21 So God created the great creatures of the sea and every living thing with which the water teems and that moves about in it, according to their kinds, and every winged bird according to its kind. And God saw that it was good. 22 God blessed them and said, “Be fruitful and increase in number and fill the water in the seas, and let the birds increase on the earth.” 23 And there was evening, and there was morning—the fifth day.
24 And God said, “Let the land produce living creatures according to their kinds: the livestock, the creatures that move along the ground, and the wild animals, each according to its kind.” And it was so. 25 God made the wild animals according to their kinds, the livestock according to their kinds, and all the creatures that move along the ground according to their kinds. And God saw that it was good.
26 Then God said, “Let us make mankind in our image, in our likeness, so that they may rule over the fish in the sea and the birds in the sky, over the livestock and all the wild animals,[a] and over all the creatures that move along the ground.”
27 So God created mankind in his own image,
    in the image of God he created them;
    male and female he created them.
28 God blessed them and said to them, “Be fruitful and increase in number; fill the earth and subdue it. Rule over the fish in the sea and the birds in the sky and over every living creature that moves on the ground.”
29 Then God said, “I give you every seed-bearing plant on the face of the whole earth and every tree that has fruit with seed in it. They will be yours for food. 30 And to all the beasts of the earth and all the birds in the sky and all the creatures that move along the ground—everything that has the breath of life in it—I give every green plant for food.” And it was so.
31 God saw all that he had made, and it was very good. And there was evening, and there was morning—the sixth day. <>

20 The Lord said to Moses, 2 “Say to the Israelites: ‘Any Israelite or any foreigner residing in Israel who sacrifices any of his children to Molek is to be put to death. The members of the community are to stone him. 3 I myself will set my face against him and will cut him off from his people; for by sacrificing his children to Molek, he has defiled my sanctuary and profaned my holy name. 4 If the members of the community close their eyes when that man sacrifices one of his children to Molek and if they fail to put him to death, 5 I myself will set my face against him and his family and will cut them off from their people together with all who follow him in prostituting themselves to Molek.
6 “‘I will set my face against anyone who turns to mediums and spiritists to prostitute themselves by following them, and I will cut them off from their people.
7 “‘Consecrate yourselves and be holy, because I am the Lord your God. 8 Keep my decrees and follow them. I am the Lord, who makes you holy.
9 “‘Anyone who curses their father or mother is to be put to death. Because they have cursed their father or mother, their blood will be on their own head.
10 “‘If a man commits adultery with another man’s wife—with the wife of his neighbor—both the adulterer and the adulteress are to be put to death.
11 “‘If a man has sexual relations with his father’s wife, he has dishonored his father. Both the man and the woman are to be put to death; their blood will be on their own heads.
12 “‘If a man has sexual relations with his daughter-in-law, both of them are to be put to death. What they have done is a perversion; their blood will be on their own heads.
13 “‘If a man has sexual relations with a man as one does with a woman, both of them have done what is detestable. They are to be put to death; their blood will be on their own heads.
14 “‘If a man marries both a woman and her mother, it is wicked. Both he and they must be burned in the fire, so that no wickedness will be among you.
15 “‘If a man has sexual relations with an animal, he is to be put to death, and you must kill the animal.
16 “‘If a woman approaches an animal to have sexual relations with it, kill both the woman and the animal. They are to be put to death; their blood will be on their own heads.
17 “‘If a man marries his sister, the daughter of either his father or his mother, and they have sexual relations, it is a disgrace. They are to be publicly removed from their people. He has dishonored his sister and will be held responsible.
18 “‘If a man has sexual relations with a woman during her monthly period, he has exposed the source of her flow, and she has also uncovered it. Both of them are to be cut off from their people.
19 “‘Do not have sexual relations with the sister of either your mother or your father, for that would dishonor a close relative; both of you would be held responsible.
20 “‘If a man has sexual relations with his aunt, he has dishonored his uncle. They will be held responsible; they will die childless.
21 “‘If a man marries his brother’s wife, it is an act of impurity; he has dishonored his brother. They will be childless.
22 “‘Keep all my decrees and laws and follow them, so that the land where I am bringing you to live may not vomit you out. 23 You must not live according to the customs of the nations I am going to drive out before you. Because they did all these things, I abhorred them. 24 But I said to you, “You will possess their land; I will give it to you as an inheritance, a land flowing with milk and honey.” I am the Lord your God, who has set you apart from the nations.
25 “‘You must therefore make a distinction between clean and unclean animals and between unclean and clean birds. Do not defile yourselves by any animal or bird or anything that moves along the ground—those that I have set apart as unclean for you. 26 You are to be holy to me because I, the Lord, am holy, and I have set you apart from the nations to be my own.
27 “‘A man or woman who is a medium or spiritist among you must be put to death. You are to stone them; their blood will be on their own heads.’”<>

31 The sayings of King Lemuel—an inspired utterance his mother taught him.
2 Listen, my son! Listen, son of my womb!
    Listen, my son, the answer to my prayers!
3 Do not spend your strength[a] on women,
    your vigor on those who ruin kings.
4 It is not for kings, Lemuel—
    it is not for kings to drink wine,
    not for rulers to crave beer,
5 lest they drink and forget what has been decreed,
    and deprive all the oppressed of their rights.
6 Let beer be for those who are perishing,
    wine for those who are in anguish!
7 Let them drink and forget their poverty
    and remember their misery no more.
8 Speak up for those who cannot speak for themselves,
    for the rights of all who are destitute.
9 Speak up and judge fairly;
    defend the rights of the poor and needy.
Epilogue: The Wife of Noble Character
10 [b]A wife of noble character who can find?
    She is worth far more than rubies.
11 Her husband has full confidence in her
    and lacks nothing of value.
12 She brings him good, not harm,
    all the days of her life.
13 She selects wool and flax
    and works with eager hands.
14 She is like the merchant ships,
    bringing her food from afar.
15 She gets up while it is still night;
    she provides food for her family
    and portions for her female servants.
16 She considers a field and buys it;
    out of her earnings she plants a vineyard.
17 She sets about her work vigorously;
    her arms are strong for her tasks.
18 She sees that her trading is profitable,
    and her lamp does not go out at night.
19 In her hand she holds the distaff
    and grasps the spindle with her fingers.
20 She opens her arms to the poor
    and extends her hands to the needy.
21 When it snows, she has no fear for her household;
    for all of them are clothed in scarlet.
22 She makes coverings for her bed;
    she is clothed in fine linen and purple.
23 Her husband is respected at the city gate,
    where he takes his seat among the elders of the land.
24 She makes linen garments and sells them,
    and supplies the merchants with sashes.
25 She is clothed with strength and dignity;
    she can laugh at the days to come.
26 She speaks with wisdom,
    and faithful instruction is on her tongue.
27 She watches over the affairs of her household
    and does not eat the bread of idleness.
28 Her children arise and call her blessed;
    her husband also, and he praises her:
29 “Many women do noble things,
    but you surpass them all.”
30 Charm is deceptive, and beauty is fleeting;
    but a woman who fears the Lord is to be praised.
31 Honor her for all that her hands have done,
    and let her works bring her praise at the city gate. <>

30 The sayings of Agur son of Jakeh—an inspired utterance.
This man’s utterance to Ithiel:
“I am weary, God,
    but I can prevail.[a]
2 Surely I am only a brute, not a man;
    I do not have human understanding.
3 I have not learned wisdom,
    nor have I attained to the knowledge of the Holy One.
4 Who has gone up to heaven and come down?
    Whose hands have gathered up the wind?
Who has wrapped up the waters in a cloak?
    Who has established all the ends of the earth?
What is his name, and what is the name of his son?
    Surely you know!
5 “Every word of God is flawless;
    he is a shield to those who take refuge in him.
6 Do not add to his words,
    or he will rebuke you and prove you a liar.
7 “Two things I ask of you, Lord;
    do not refuse me before I die:
8 Keep falsehood and lies far from me;
    give me neither poverty nor riches,
    but give me only my daily bread.
9 Otherwise, I may have too much and disown you
    and say, ‘Who is the Lord?’
Or I may become poor and steal,
    and so dishonor the name of my God.
10 “Do not slander a servant to their master,
    or they will curse you, and you will pay for it.
11 “There are those who curse their fathers
    and do not bless their mothers;
12 those who are pure in their own eyes
    and yet are not cleansed of their filth;
13 those whose eyes are ever so haughty,
    whose glances are so disdainful;
14 those whose teeth are swords
    and whose jaws are set with knives
to devour the poor from the earth
    and the needy from among mankind.
15 “The leech has two daughters.
    ‘Give! Give!’ they cry.
“There are three things that are never satisfied,
    four that never say, ‘Enough!’:
16 the grave, the barren womb,
    land, which is never satisfied with water,
    and fire, which never says, ‘Enough!’
17 “The eye that mocks a father,
    that scorns an aged mother,
will be pecked out by the ravens of the valley,
    will be eaten by the vultures.
18 “There are three things that are too amazing for me,
    four that I do not understand:
19 the way of an eagle in the sky,
    the way of a snake on a rock,
the way of a ship on the high seas,
    and the way of a man with a young woman.
20 “This is the way of an adulterous woman:
    She eats and wipes her mouth
    and says, ‘I’ve done nothing wrong.’
21 “Under three things the earth trembles,
    under four it cannot bear up:
22 a servant who becomes king,
    a godless fool who gets plenty to eat,
23 a contemptible woman who gets married,
    and a servant who displaces her mistress.
24 “Four things on earth are small,
    yet they are extremely wise:
25 Ants are creatures of little strength,
    yet they store up their food in the summer;
26 hyraxes are creatures of little power,
    yet they make their home in the crags;
27 locusts have no king,
    yet they advance together in ranks;
28 a lizard can be caught with the hand,
    yet it is found in kings’ palaces.
29 “There are three things that are stately in their stride,
    four that move with stately bearing:
30 a lion, mighty among beasts,
    who retreats before nothing;
31 a strutting rooster, a he-goat,
    and asking secure against revolt.[b]
32 “If you play the fool and exalt yourself,
    or if you plan evil,
    clap your hand over your mouth!
33 For as churning cream produces butter,
    and as twisting the nose produces blood,
    so stirring up anger produces strife.”<>

א Aleph
1 Blessed are those whose ways are blameless,
    who walk according to the law of the Lord.
2 Blessed are those who keep his statutes
    and seek him with all their heart—
3 they do no wrong
    but follow his ways.
4 You have laid down precepts
    that are to be fully obeyed.
5 Oh, that my ways were steadfast
    in obeying your decrees!

    do not utterly forsake me.

    wonderful things in your law.
19 I am a stranger on earth;
    do not hide your commands from me.
20 My soul is consumed with longing
    for your laws at all times.
21 You rebuke the arrogant, who are accursed,
    those who stray from your commands.
22 Remove from me their scorn and contempt,

24 Your statutes are my delight;
    they are my counselors.

    that I may meditate on your wonderful deeds.
28 My soul is weary with sorrow;
    strengthen me according to your word.

    and obey it with all my heart.
35 Direct me in the path of your commands,
    for there I find delight.
36 Turn my heart toward your statutes
    and not toward selfish gain.
37 Turn my eyes away from worthless things;
    preserve my life according to your word.[c]
38 Fulfill your promise to your servant,
    so that you may be feared.
39 Take away the disgrace I dread,
    for your laws are good.
40 How I long for your precepts!
    In your righteousness preserve my life.
ו Waw
41 May your unfailing love come to me, Lord,
    your salvation, according to your promise;
42 then I can answer anyone who taunts me,

43 Never take your word of truth from my mouth,
    for I have put my hope in your laws.
44 I will always obey your law,
    for ever and ever.
45 I will walk about in freedom,
    for I have sought out your precepts.
46 I will speak of your statutes before kings
    and will not be put to shame,
47 for I delight in your commands
    because I love them.
48 I reach out for your commands, which I love,
    that I may meditate on your decrees.

49 Remember your word to your servant,
    for you have given me hope.
50 My comfort in my suffering is this:
    Your promise preserves my life.
51 The arrogant mock me unmercifully,
    but I do not turn from your law.
52 I remember, Lord, your ancient laws,
    and I find comfort in them.
53 Indignation grips me because of the wicked,
    who have forsaken your law.
54 Your decrees are the theme of my song
    wherever I lodge.
55 In the night, Lord, I remember your name,
    that I may keep your law.
56 This has been my practice:
    I obey your precepts.

70 Their hearts are callous and unfeeling,
    but I delight in your law.

    so that I might learn your decrees.
72 The law from your mouth is more precious to me
    than thousands of pieces of silver and gold.

82 My eyes fail, looking for your promise;
    I say, “When will you comfort me?”
83 Though I am like a wineskin in the smoke,
    I do not forget your decrees.
84 How long must your servant wait?
    When will you punish my persecutors?
85 The arrogant dig pits to trap me,
    contrary to your law.
86 All your commands are trustworthy;
    help me, for I am being persecuted without cause.
87 They almost wiped me from the earth,

    do not let my hopes be dashed.
117 Uphold me, and I will be delivered;
    I will always have regard for your decrees.
118 You reject all who stray from your decrees,
    for their delusions come to nothing.
119 All the wicked of the earth you discard like dross;
    therefore I love your statutes.
120 My flesh trembles in fear of you;
    I stand in awe of your laws.

    looking for your righteous promise.
124 Deal with your servant according to your love
    and teach me your decrees.
125 I am your servant; give me discernment
    that I may understand your statutes.

For about 100 years, the scientific community has repeatedly changed its collective mind over what viruses are. First seen as poisons, then as life-forms, then biological chemicals, viruses today are thought of as being in a gray area between living and nonliving: they cannot replicate on their own but can do so in truly living cells and can also affect the behavior of their hosts profoundly.
The seemingly simple question of whether or not viruses are alive has probably defied a simple answer all these years because it raises a fundamental issue: What exactly defines “life?” A precise scientific definition of life is an elusive thing, but most observers would agree that life includes certain qualities in addition to an ability to replicate. For example, a living entity is in a state bounded by birth and death. Living organisms also are thought to require a degree of biochemical autonomy, carrying on the metabolic activities that produce the molecules and energy needed to sustain the organism. This level of autonomy is essential to most definitions.
Viruses, however, parasitize essentially all biomolecular aspects of life. That is, they depend on the host cell for the raw materials and energy necessary for nucleic acid synthesis, protein synthesis, processing and transport, and all other biochemical activities that allow the virus to multiply and spread. One might then conclude that even though these processes come under viral direction, viruses are simply non-living parasites of living metabolic systems. But a spectrum may exist between what is certainly alive and what is not.
A rock is not alive. A metabolically active sack, devoid of genetic material and the potential for propagation, is also not alive. A bacterium, though, is alive. Although it is a single cell, it can generate energy and the molecules needed to sustain itself, and it can reproduce. But what about a seed? A seed might not be considered alive. Yet it has a potential for life, and it may be destroyed. In this regard, viruses resemble seeds more than they do live cells.
Another way to think about life is as an emergent property of a collection of certain non-living things. Both life and consciousness are examples of emergent complex systems. They each require a critical level of complexity or interaction to achieve their respective states. A neuron by itself, or even in a network of nerves, is not conscious—whole brain complexity is needed. A virus, too, fails to reach a critical complexity. So life itself is an emergent, complex state, but it is made from the same fundamental, physical building blocks that constitute a virus. Approached from this perspective, viruses, though not fully alive, may be thought of as being more than inert matter: they verge on life.
In fact, in October 2004, French researchers announced findings that illustrate afresh just how close some viruses might come. Didier Raoult and his colleagues at the University of the Mediterranean in Marseille announced that they had sequenced the genome of the largest known virus, Mimivirus, which was discovered in 1992. The virus, about the same size as a small bacterium, infects amoebae. Sequence analysis of the virus revealed numerous genes previously thought to exist only in cellular organisms. Some of these genes are involved in making the proteins encoded by the viral DNA and may make it easier for Mimivirus to co-opt host cell replication systems. As the research team noted in its report in the journal Science, the enormous complexity of the Mimivirus’s genetic complement “challenges the established frontier between viruses and parasitic cellular organisms.”<>

The question of human overpopulation and its relationship to human carrying capacity has been controversial for over two centuries. In 1798 the Reverend Thomas Malthus put forward the hypothesis that population growth would exceed the growth of resources, leading to the periodic reduction of human numbers by either “positive checks”, such as disease, famine, and war, or “preventive checks”, by which (in the absence of contraception) Malthus meant restrictions on marriage. This “Malthusian view” was rapidly accepted by most politicians, demographers, and the general public, and remained popular until fairly recently.
Malthus's worst fears were not borne out through the century following his death in 1834—food production largely kept pace with the slowly growing global population. However, soon after 1934, the global population began to rise steeply as antibiotics, vaccines, and technology increased life expectancy. By the 1960s, concerns of a mismatch between global population and global food supply peaked—expressed in books such as Paul Ehrlich's 1968 The Population Bomb. This book predicted a future scarred by increasing famine, epidemic, and war—the three main Malthusian positive checks.
In 1966, United States President Lyndon Johnson shipped wheat to India to avert a famine on the condition that the country accelerate its already vigorous family planning campaign. Johnson was part of an unbroken series of US presidents concerned with the harmful effects of rapid population growth in developing countries. This line extended (at least) from John F. Kennedy to Jimmy Carter. George H. W. Bush was also sympathetic to this view, prior to becoming vice president in 1981.
But the 1970s surprised population watchers. Instead of being a period shadowed by calamitous famine, the new crop strains introduced by the “Green Revolution” (especially grains such as rice, wheat, and maize) caused a dramatic increase in the global production of cereals, the main source of energy in the global diet. Among the development community, despair turned into cautious optimism. By the end of the decade, the public health community felt sufficiently empowered to proclaim “Health for All by the Year 2000”. Average life expectancy continued to zoom upwards almost everywhere.
The introduction of safe contraception contributed to a rapid fertility decline in many countries. But while the rate of global population growth declined from its peak in the late 1960s, the absolute increment of increase in annual global population continued to grow. Most population-related scientists, including food scientists and demographers, as well as US President Jimmy Carter, continued to be very concerned about global overpopulation. In 1970, the father of the Green Revolution, the agricultural scientist Norman Borlaug, was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. In his Nobel lecture, Borlaug warned that the success of the Green Revolution would buy a breathing space for humankind of three decades, unless equivalent action was taken to reduce fertility rates.<>

Atlas models are systems of exchangeable positive-valued diffusion processes with drift and variance parameters that depend only on the rank of the process. It has been shown mathematically that Zipf's law holds for Atlas models that satisfy certain natural regularity conditions.[25] Atlas models can be used to represent empirical systems of time-dependent multivariate data, including, e.g., the frequency of words in a written language or the size of companies. An Atlas model that represents an empirical system will have the same stationary distribution as the empirical system, so if the Atlas model follows Zipf's law, the system will also follow Zipf's law. Since Atlas models that satisfy natural regularity conditions follow Zipf's law, this accounts for its universality.[26]
In the figure above of the 10 million Wikipedia words, the log-log plots are not precisely straight lines but rather slightly concave curves with a tangent of slope -1 at some point along the curve. Such distributions are usually referred to as quasi-Zipfian distributions, and most systems of time-dependent empirical data that are said to follow Zipf's law are actually quasi-Zipfian. Quasi-Zipfian systems can be represented by quasi-Atlas models, and quasi-Atlas models are amenable to mathematical treatment similar to that for Zipf's law.<>

Zipf's law (/zɪf/, German: [ts͡ɪpf]) is an empirical law formulated using mathematical statistics that refers to the fact that for many types of data studied in the physical and social sciences, the rank-frequency distribution is an inverse relation. The Zipfian distribution is one of a family of related discrete power law probability distributions. It is related to the zeta distribution, but is not identical.
Zipf's law was originally formulated in terms of quantitative linguistics, stating that given some corpus of natural language utterances, the frequency of any word is inversely proportional to its rank in the frequency table. Thus the most frequent word will occur approximately twice as often as the second most frequent word, three times as often as the third most frequent word, etc. For example, in the Brown Corpus of American English text, the word "the" is the most frequently occurring word, and by itself accounts for nearly 7% of all word occurrences (69,971 out of slightly over 1 million). True to Zipf's Law, the second-place word "of" accounts for slightly over 3.5% of words (36,411 occurrences), followed by "and" (28,852). Only 135 vocabulary items are needed to account for half the Brown Corpus.[1]
The law is named after the American linguist George Kingsley Zipf, who popularized it and sought to explain it, though he did not claim to have originated it.[2] The French stenographer Jean-Baptiste Estoup appears to have noticed the regularity before Zipf.[3] It was also noted in 1913 by German physicist Felix Auerbach.[4]
The law is similar in concept, though not identical in distribution, to Benford's law.

Other data sets
The same relationship occurs in many other rankings of human-created systems,[5] such as the ranks of mathematical expressions or ranks of notes in music[6] and even in uncontrolled environments, such as corporation sizes, income rankings, ranks of number of people watching the same TV channel,[7] cells' transcriptomes[8] and so on. The appearance of the distribution in rankings of cities by population was first noticed by Felix Auerbach in 1913,[4] leading to a broad literature of Zipf's law for cities.[9] However, more recent empirical[10][11] and theoretical[12] studies have challenged the relevance of Zipf's law for cities.
Empirically, a data set can be tested to see whether Zipf's law applies by checking the goodness of fit of an empirical distribution to the hypothesized power law distribution with a Kolmogorov–Smirnov test, and then comparing the (log) likelihood ratio of the power law distribution to alternative distributions like an exponential distribution or lognormal distribution.[13]
Theoretical review
Zipf's law is most easily observed by plotting the data on a log-log graph, with the axes being the logarithm of rank order, and logarithm of frequency. For example, as described in the introduction, the word "the" would appear at x = log(1) (order rank = 1), and y = log(69 971) . It is also possible to plot reciprocal rank against frequency or reciprocal frequency or interword interval against rank.[2] The data conform to Zipf's law to the extent that the plot is linear.
Formally, define:
N   to be the number of elements;
k     their rank;
s     the value of the exponent characterizing the distribution (s at least 1).
Zipf's law then predicts that out of a population of N elements, the element of order rank k, has the normalized frequency f ( k; s, N ) :
{\displaystyle \ f(k;s,N)~=~{\frac {\left[{\frac {1}{\ k^{s}\ }}\right]}{\ \left[\ \sum \limits _{n=1}^{N}{\frac {1}{\ n^{s}\ }}\ \right]\ \ }}~\equiv ~f_{k}\ .}{\displaystyle \ f(k;s,N)~=~{\frac {\left[{\frac {1}{\ k^{s}\ }}\right]}{\ \left[\ \sum \limits _{n=1}^{N}{\frac {1}{\ n^{s}\ }}\ \right]\ \ }}~\equiv ~f_{k}\ .}
Zipf's law holds if the number of elements with a given frequency is a random variable with power law distribution {\displaystyle \ p(f)={\frac {\alpha }{\ f_{k}^{1+1/s}\ }}\ ,}{\displaystyle \ p(f)={\frac {\alpha }{\ f_{k}^{1+1/s}\ }}\ ,} ( fk is the value of the expression immediately above).[14]
It has been claimed that this representation of Zipf's law is more suitable for statistical testing, and in this way it has been analyzed in more than 30,000 English texts. The goodness-of-fit tests yield that only about 15% of the texts are statistically compatible with this form of Zipf's law. Slight variations in the definition of Zipf's law can increase this percentage up to close to 50%.[15
In the example of the frequency of words in the English language, N is the number of words in the English language and, if we use the classic version of Zipf's law, the characterizing exponent s is 1 (minimum possible). The value f ( k; s, N ) will then be the fraction of the time the kth most common word occurs.
The law may also be written:
{\displaystyle \ f(k;s,N)={\frac {1}{\ k^{s}\ H_{N,s}\ }}}{\displaystyle \ f(k;s,N)={\frac {1}{\ k^{s}\ H_{N,s}\ }}}
where HN,s is the N‑th generalized harmonic number.

The simplest case of Zipf's law is a "
1
/
  f  
" function, with s = 1 . Given a set of Zipf-distributed frequencies, sorted from most common to least common, the second most common frequency will occur half as often as the first, the third most common frequency will occur 
1
/
 3 
 as often as the first, and the n‑th most common frequency will occur 
1
/
 n 
 as often as the first. However, this cannot hold exactly: Because items must occur an integer number of times, there cannot be 2.5 occurrences of a word. Nevertheless, over fairly wide ranges, and to a fairly good approximation, many natural phenomena obey Zipf's law.
In human languages, word frequencies have a very heavy-tailed distribution, and can therefore be modeled reasonably well by a Zipf distribution with an s close to 1.
As long as the exponent s exceeds 1, it is possible for such a law to hold with infinitely many words, since if s > 1 then
{\displaystyle \ \zeta (s)=\sum _{n=1}^{\infty }{\frac {1}{\ n^{s}\ }}<\infty \ .}{\displaystyle \ \zeta (s)=\sum _{n=1}^{\infty }{\frac {1}{\ n^{s}\ }}<\infty \ .}
where ζ is Riemann's zeta function.

Although Zipf's Law holds for all languages, even non-natural ones like Esperanto,[16] the reason is still not well understood.[17] However, it may be partially explained by the statistical analysis of randomly generated texts. Wentian Li has shown that in a document in which each character has been chosen randomly from a uniform distribution of all letters (plus a space character), the "words" with different lengths follow the macro-trend of the Zipf's law (the more probable words are the shortest with equal probability).[18] Vitold Belevitch, in a paper entitled On the Statistical Laws of Linguistic Distribution, offers a mathematical derivation. He took a large class of well-behaved statistical distributions (not only the normal distribution) and expressed them in terms of rank. He then expanded each expression into a Taylor series. In every case Belevitch obtained the remarkable result that a first-order truncation of the series resulted in Zipf's law. Further, a second-order truncation of the Taylor series resulted in Mandelbrot's law.[19][20]
The principle of least effort is another possible explanation: Zipf himself proposed that neither speakers nor hearers using a given language want to work any harder than necessary to reach understanding, and the process that results in approximately equal distribution of effort leads to the observed Zipf distribution.[21][22]
Similarly, preferential attachment (intuitively, "the rich get richer" or "success breeds success") that results in the Yule–Simon distribution has been shown to fit word frequency versus rank in language[23] and population versus city rank[24] better than Zipf's law. It was originally derived to explain population versus rank in species by Yule, and applied to cities by Simon.
Mathematical explanation
Atlas models are systems of exchangeable positive-valued diffusion processes with drift and variance parameters that depend only on the rank of the process. It has been shown mathematically that Zipf's law holds for Atlas models that satisfy certain natural regularity conditions.[25] Atlas models can be used to represent empirical systems of time-dependent multivariate data, including, e.g., the frequency of words in a written language or the size of companies. An Atlas model that represents an empirical system will have the same stationary distribution as the empirical system, so if the Atlas model follows Zipf's law, the system will also follow Zipf's law. Since Atlas models that satisfy natural regularity conditions follow Zipf's law, this accounts for its universality.[26]
In the figure above of the 10 million Wikipedia words, the log-log plots are not precisely straight lines but rather slightly concave curves with a tangent of slope -1 at some point along the curve. Such distributions are usually referred to as quasi-Zipfian distributions, and most systems of time-dependent empirical data that are said to follow Zipf's law are actually quasi-Zipfian. Quasi-Zipfian systems can be represented by quasi-Atlas models, and quasi-Atlas models are amenable to mathematical treatment similar to that for Zipf's law.
Related laws
A plot of word frequency in Wikipedia (November 27, 2006). The plot is in log-log coordinates. x  is rank of a word in the frequency table; y  is the total number of the word's occurrences. Most popular words are "the", "of" and "and", as expected. Zipf's law corresponds to the middle linear portion of the curve, roughly following the green (1/x)  line, while the early part is closer to the magenta (1/x0.5) line while the later part is closer to the cyan (1/(k + x)2.0) line. These lines correspond to three distinct parameterizations of the Zipf–Mandelbrot distribution, overall a broken power law with three segments: a head, middle, and tail.
Zipf's law in fact refers more generally to frequency distributions of "rank data", in which the relative frequency of the nth-ranked item is given by the zeta distribution, 1/(nsζ(s)), where the parameter s > 1 indexes the members of this family of probability distributions. Indeed, Zipf's law is sometimes synonymous with "zeta distribution", since probability distributions are sometimes called "laws". This distribution is sometimes called the Zipfian distribution.
A generalization of Zipf's law is the Zipf–Mandelbrot law, proposed by Benoit Mandelbrot, whose frequencies are:
{\displaystyle f(k;N,q,s)={\frac {[{\text{constant}}]}{(k+q)^{s}}}.\,}{\displaystyle f(k;N,q,s)={\frac {[{\text{constant}}]}{(k+q)^{s}}}.\,}
The "constant" is the reciprocal of the Hurwitz zeta function evaluated at s. In practice, as easily observable in distribution plots for large corpora, the observed distribution can be modelled more accurately as a sum of separate distributions for different subsets or subtypes of words that follow different parameterizations of the Zipf–Mandelbrot distribution, in particular the closed class of functional words exhibit s lower than 1, while open-ended vocabulary growth with document size and corpus size require s greater than 1 for convergence of the Generalized Harmonic Series.[2]
Zipfian distributions can be obtained from Pareto distributions by an exchange of variables.[14]
The Zipf distribution is sometimes called the discrete Pareto distribution[27] because it is analogous to the continuous Pareto distribution in the same way that the discrete uniform distribution is analogous to the continuous uniform distribution.
The tail frequencies of the Yule–Simon distribution are approximately
{\displaystyle f(k;\rho )\approx {\frac {[{\text{constant}}]}{k^{\rho +1}}}}{\displaystyle f(k;\rho )\approx {\frac {[{\text{constant}}]}{k^{\rho +1}}}}
for any choice of ρ > 0.
In the parabolic fractal distribution, the logarithm of the frequency is a quadratic polynomial of the logarithm of the rank. This can markedly improve the fit over a simple power-law relationship.[28] Like fractal dimension, it is possible to calculate Zipf dimension, which is a useful parameter in the analysis of texts.[29]
It has been argued that Benford's law is a special bounded case of Zipf's law,[28] with the connection between these two laws being explained by their both originating from scale invariant functional relations from statistical physics and critical phenomena.[30] The ratios of probabilities in Benford's law are not constant. The leading digits of data satisfying Zipf's law with s = 1 satisfy Benford's law.

Applications
In information theory, a symbol (event, signal) of probability {\displaystyle p}p contains {\displaystyle -\log _{2}(p)}{\displaystyle -\log _{2}(p)} bits of information. Hence, Zipf's law for natural numbers: {\displaystyle \Pr(x)\approx 1/x}{\displaystyle \Pr(x)\approx 1/x} is equivalent with number {\displaystyle x}x containing {\displaystyle \log _{2}(x)}\log _{2}(x) bits of information. To add information from a symbol of probability {\displaystyle p}p into information already stored in a natural number {\displaystyle x}x, we should go to {\displaystyle x'}x' such that {\displaystyle \log _{2}(x')\approx \log _{2}(x)+\log _{2}(1/p)}{\displaystyle \log _{2}(x')\approx \log _{2}(x)+\log _{2}(1/p)}, or equivalently {\displaystyle x'\approx x/p}{\displaystyle x'\approx x/p}. For instance, in standard binary system we would have {\displaystyle x'=2x+s}{\displaystyle x'=2x+s}, what is optimal for {\displaystyle \Pr(s=0)=\Pr(s=1)=1/2}{\displaystyle \Pr(s=0)=\Pr(s=1)=1/2} probability distribution. Using {\displaystyle x'\approx x/p}{\displaystyle x'\approx x/p} rule for a general probability distribution is the base of Asymmetric Numeral Systems family of entropy coding methods used in data compression, whose state distribution is also governed by Zipf's law.
Zipf's law has been used for extraction of parallel fragments of texts out of comparable corpora.[31] Zipf's law has also been used by Laurance Doyle and others at the SETI Institute as part of the search for extraterrestrial intelligence.[32][33]
The Voynich Manuscript, which is a 15th-century codex, also falls in line with Zipf's law, indicating that text is most likely not a hoax but rather written in an obscure language or cipher.[34][35]

Zipf’s Law describes one aspect of the statistical distribution in words in language: if you rank words by their frequency in a sufficiently large collection of texts and then plot the frequency against the rank, you get a logarithmic curve (or, if you graph on a log scale, you get a straight line).  In other words, there is a small number of words that occur quite often, and then a very large number of words that occur at the statistical equivalent of zero–but, they do occur.  What this means for the second-language learner is that every single day you will come across words that you don’t know.
I’ve been studying French for the past couple years, and this blog is primarily about new words that I came across in the course of my day–mostly when I’m in France, but also just listening to the radio in the US.  I also occasionally write about Spanish, since I spend one week a year in Guatemala, and I write about medical vocabulary a lot, since I go there with a group of surgeons.  When I started getting quite a few international readers, I began adding links to the definitions of English words, especially obscure and slang ones.  If you’re only interested in French or Spanish, use the tags to find posts on one or the other.  If you’re only interested in vocabulary or grammar, look for the vocabulary tag or the morphosyntax tag–any post that doesn’t have one of those tags is probably all cultural notes.  I’m a computational linguist by training, and every once in a while I write about linguistics and/or about computer programs that process language in some way or another. <>

In June of 1968, a group of Christian parents met together and prayed that God would direct them in the establishment of a new Christian school in Miami. From that meeting came a ground swell of support that led to the purchase of a church building and surrounding property which was to become Florida Christian School. Florida Christian was established as a Christian school with a family atmosphere. Our curriculum is Christ-centered rather than man-centered, making Christ preeminent in every aspect of the educational program. It is a school where parental involvement is high and teachers are known to be loving and caring toward their students.
Even though there has been significant growth through the years, the same loving spirit still characterizes the school. From the first one hundred original students to the over eleven hundred of today, a common thread of pride in the school is blended with their appreciation for the faculty and staff who sacrificially have ministered to their students and to the community throughout the years. <>
